## MANCALA
A contribution for [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming)'s Bot Programming Challenge.

Mancala is a widely-played two-player board game that involves a board with two rows of six cups, with each player having a storage cup on their side. The objective of the game is to collect more stones than your opponent. To achieve this, players must strategize by distributing stones into cups, capturing their opponent's stones, and taking free turns.
